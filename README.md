# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form

## Plan on improving the project

With the Coffee shop project grew great difficultly and challenges that made it even more rewarding to overcome. Not only are you growing more in depth of creating your own HTML document but you are breaking the CSS according to BEM rules!
